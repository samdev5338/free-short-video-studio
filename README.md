> **Fully online, completely free AI short video generator** — no install, no GPU, no credit card. Type in an idea, AI automatically splits it into 2-5 scenes, generates each scene with text-to-video, and stitches them into a complete short video right in your browser.

## 🚀 Try It Now — No Install Needed

**▶ [video.lichuanyang.top/studio](https://samdev5338.github.io)**

> Just paste a free [Agnes AI](https://samdev5338.github.io) API key (stored in your browser's localStorage, never uploaded to any server) and start creating AI videos at zero cost.

## ✨ Features

- **Fully in-browser** — everything runs on your device: FFmpeg.js wasm stitching, localStorage-only API key, no backend server for video generation.
- **Creative → Scenes → Video** — AI splits your idea into 2-5 scenes, generates each scene, then stitches the final video with optional audio.
- **Multi-scene editing** — edit scene prompts, re-generate individual scenes, swap scene order before rendering.
- **13 languages** — Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Indonesian, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.

> ⚠️ **Status: under active construction** — core generation & stitching work; more features are being built continuously.

## 🛠 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # static export to out/ (Cloudflare Pages)
```

## 💡 How to Use

1. Open the site and click the **API Key** panel.
2. Get a free Agnes API key at [platform.agnes-ai.com](https://samdev5338.github.io) (no credit card required).
3. Paste the key — it is saved only in your browser's `localStorage` and never uploaded anywhere.
4. Enter your video idea → AI splits scenes → generate each scene → stitch & export in the browser.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + next-intl
- `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` (ffmpeg.wasm) — in-browser video stitching, loaded from CDN
- Cloudflare Pages — static export + `functions/` video-download CORS proxy

## 📦 Deploy

- Platform: Cloudflare Pages, build command `npm run build`, output directory `out/`.
- The `functions/` directory is automatically recognized by Cloudflare Pages as a Pages Function (video-download CORS proxy) — no extra config needed.
- User-provided API keys stay in the browser's `localStorage`; nothing is uploaded to any server.
